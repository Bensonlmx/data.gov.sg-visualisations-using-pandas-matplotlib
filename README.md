# Data.Gov.Sg-Visualisations-Using-Python-Pandas-Matplotlib

## Easier with Pandas
A collection of data science scripts for data analysis in Python, using publicly available .gov datasets. The algorithms are implemented in two ways: from scratch in Python and using the well-known workhorse that's Pandas library, with visualisations done using Matplotlib. (Check out my other repository using only NumPy to work through the datasets - spot any difference?)

### Python Libraries Used 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install all of the libraries, run the commands:

- ```sudo apt-get install python-pip```
- ```sudo apt-get install python-pandas```
- ```sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib```

### Disclaimer
- Do remember to change the fname to = "/whatever/yourrfolder/file.csv" in order for the code to work
- For this reason, I'd recommend using Spyder to load rather than the initially-friendlier Jupyter Notebook
